# ENSF338W23_Assignment2
Source code files for ENSF 338, Assignment 2.

File ex1.3.py is a Python file, with code using the method of memoization, with the given the Fibonacci sequence in the file.

File ex1.5.py is a Python file, with code that times the original given code in the handout and the improved, memoized, code by computing the functions with inputs from 0 - 35.
After timing each function with inputs 0 through 35, it is then plotted in MatPlotLib to show the difference in timing as a line graph.
It's then used to answer a following question of comparing the results based on computational analysis.
